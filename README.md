# luggage_robot_webots

In this project, we developed an automated robotic arm system using the Webots simulation platform to efficiently sort luggage based on flight numbers. The system was designed to handle luggage coming from a conveyor belt, identify the corresponding flight number, and accurately transfer the baggage onto one of three designated conveyor belts corresponding to the specific flight destinations.

The implementation involved programming the robotic arm to perform precise movements and manipulations, ensuring the correct sorting of each piece of luggage with minimal errors. The system was tested extensively within the Webots desktop application simulator to optimize accuracy and efficiency before final deployment.

This project not only enhanced my skills in robotics and automation but also equipped me with robust problem-solving techniques applicable to real-world scenarios in the aviationÂ industry.
